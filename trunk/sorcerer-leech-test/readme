This scripts are made for checkking if the sources in the grimoire can 
be leeched, if a source to a given spell can not be leeched it will 
be displayed in /var/tmp/leech.

The script create a temporary directory: _leech in /var/cache/sources, 
into which it moves the source it is going to try to leech (if it exist), 
and which can be moved back if it does not exist.

There are two ways that one can use this script:

    leechgrimoiresources :
	    Without any parameters it will try to download all sources
			
    leechgrimoiresources t :
	    It will try to download all spells which starts with t.
