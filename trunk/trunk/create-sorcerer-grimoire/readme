These scripts are made for extracting the svn grimoire for the sorcerer
distribution, and is meant to be executed in a cron script (eventhough
I have not yet testet this, so you are on your own :) ).

This tool is made up of one script, and one configuration file (to be 
placed in /etc and set appropriate rights).

The script: createsvngrimoire extract the svn from berlios and put it
into the location specified in the configuration file.
After this script has run the tarball will be placed in the main directory
as specified in the configuration file (SVNDATALOCATION variable)

The script also try to download a grimoire tarball from berlios, and if it
is not there it will automatically try to upload it (well not exactly as 
the line put_grimoire_to_berlios is currently commented out)

The configuration file: contains three values: 

    BERLIOS_USERNAME=the berlios username	- to upload grimoire to ftp
    BERLIOS_PASSWORD=the berlios password	- to upload grimoire to ftp
    SVNDATALOCATION=Where to place the tarballs and the svn
    SVNBERLIOSACC=Default action is to use anonymous access, but if one absolutely
		needs to use an berlios account to fetch the svn use Y here.
		If this last line is not there it will use anonymous
		
Par example:
		
    BERLIOS_USERNAME=berliosuser
    BERLIOS_PASSWORD=password
    SVNDATALOCATION=/opt/svn
    SVNBERLIOSACC=N
    
Requirements: svn, bash, tar, expect
